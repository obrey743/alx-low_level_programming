Project 0x13. C - More Singly Linked Lists
This project contains C programs that demonstrate the use of singly linked lists. Singly linked lists are a type of data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, each containing a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

The programs in this project build upon the concepts introduced in the previous project, 0x12. C - Singly Linked Lists. These programs demonstrate more advanced operations on singly linked lists, such as inserting and deleting nodes, reversing the order of the list, and sorting the list.
